# Regis Examen

> For "intellectual and spiritual growth grounded in a deepening relationship with Christ."

This is a website specifically made for [Regis High Shool](https://www.regis.org/) to use for writing and recording weekly examens.

The original process comprised:

1.  Write out entire new examen script with list of prompts and pauses included
2.  Use Audacity to record a read-through of the script without pauses
3.  Use Audacity to generate the silent pauses in between prompts
4.  Use Audacity to add a music backing track and raise/lower volume as prompts are played
5.  Edited audio is exported and saved

This website addresses that entire list and more, as through the website staff can:

1.  Write an examen prompt by prompt
2.  Record the audio in-browser for each prompt
3.  Set the pause of each prompt
4.  Upload a musical backing track
5.  Have the entire examen pieced together automatically
6.  Have the backing track automatically fade in/out with prompts
7.  Allow viewing of posted examens by students, faculty, and the general public
8.  Allow Regis students/faculty to login with their Regis Google accounts to personalize, e.g. pin favorite examens
